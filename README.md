# 🚀 Specialists Plan W25

Welcome to the **Specialists-Plan-W25** repository! This repository is dedicated to students who have completed the Pupils Plan or have an equivalent background in problem-solving and algorithm design. Each week we tackle advanced topics in dynamic programming, data structures, and number theory, building up to more complex algorithms and techniques.

## 🌐 VJudge Group

Join our problem-solving community on [VJudge](https://vjudge.net/group/guc) to participate in contests and practice sessions. The group contains problem sets for each week, and you can submit your solutions and track your progress.

<!--
## 📂 Structure

Each week's folder contains:
- A **Problem Set**: A collection of curated problems to practice the concepts of the week.
- **Solutions**: Detailed solutions for the problems discussed in the sessions.
- **Extra Challenges**: A set of harder problems that may require creative approaches or advanced tricks.

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests for new solutions, optimizations, or alternate approaches. Collaboration is encouraged!

## 🌱 Goal

The aim of this plan is to push students beyond basic problem-solving, introduce more sophisticated techniques, and build a strong foundation for competitive programming or advanced algorithm design.

Good luck, and happy solving! 🎯
